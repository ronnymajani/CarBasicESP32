Navigate to “C/C++ General” -> “Preprocessor Include Paths” property page:

Click the “Providers” tab
In the list of providers, click “CDT Cross GCC Built-in Compiler Settings”. 
Under “Command to get compiler specs”, replace the text ${COMMAND} at the beginning of the line with xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc. 
This means the full “Command to get compiler specs” should be xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc ${FLAGS} -E -P -v -dD "${INPUTS}".
In the list of providers, click “CDT GCC Build Output Parser” and type xtensa-esp32-elf- at the beginning of the Compiler command pattern. 
This means the full Compiler command pattern should be xtensa-esp32-elf-(g?cc)|([gc]\+\+)|(clang)
